* Goals
** 15 minute goals
What are some things I could optimistically hack together in 15 minutes?
What would it look like to work on one of those things for 5 minutes?
*** TODO Clear window with color
*** TODO Plan how to render at a lower resolution
Just draw up some plans in my notebook.
*** TODO Find a test image and see if the lower resolution rendering works
